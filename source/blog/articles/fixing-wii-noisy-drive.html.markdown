It's been more than 6 months that my Wii was producing an awful lawn mower sound in the disk drive, and I finally decided to open it up and "try" to fix the problem.

Since I've seen other people with similar problems on YouTube, such as:

<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="425" height="344" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/12-NW8SEnME&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="425" height="344" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/12-NW8SEnME&amp;hl=en&amp;fs=1" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

I decided to put my experience on how I fixed it.

You will need Nintendo screwdriver, which you can easily find on eBay.

I've used the following video as a guide during the disassembling of my console:

There is one screw above your Wii's drive that is right above the power button, loose it a little and stick something to level the plate a little bit up. You can test this with your Wii still opened until you don't hear that noise anymore.

Here is a front picture of my fixed Wii ([Flickr notes](http://www.flickr.com/photos/pirelenito/2665570671/)):

I should have taken a picture from above, but I was too happy that the problem was gone, that I just remember to register how I did it after most of my Wii had been put back together already.

Hope it helps someone!
