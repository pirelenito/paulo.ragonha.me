A lot has changed since my 2011 talk on Single Page Applications, and I've decided to give another try on public speaking.

It is TDC again, in its [2013 incarnation](http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br/tdc/2013/florianopolis/trilha-html5-e-javascript#programacao), and my talk is all about the importance of testing, how easy it is to get started and how fast you can become with the help of some propper tooling!

The talk covers [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/), [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/) and [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/).
